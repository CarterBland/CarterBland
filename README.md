### Hey, I'm Carter

I'm currently a Software Engineer Team Lead at Midwestern Interactive. As a team lead I manage a team of software engineers on various projects, as-well as their technical growth. This is a new aspect of my career, and I strive to become better everyday.

As an engineer, I am experienced in multiple frameworks and languages including: laravel, nest, next, react, react native, and many more. I have written various packages as-well, some widely used by the community. I also enjoy being able to lead the engineering vision of a project, and have the ability and confidence in solving technical problems with the most efficient solution.
