I'm currently a Software Engineer Team Lead at Midwestern Interactive where I manage a team of engineers on various projects, as-well as their technical growth. I enjoy leading software projects from start to finish and being able to architect long-lasting and maintainable software.

As an engineer Iâ€™m experienced in multiple frameworks and languages including: laravel, nest, next, react, react native, and many more. I have written various packages as-well, and have a passion for creating tools that make development more streamlined.
